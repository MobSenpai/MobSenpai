<h2>Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<h3 align="center">A passionate frontend developer from India</h3>
<p align="left">Very passionate about coding. I am not a professional, still on first steps in this world and want to explore it.ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p align="left">Originally I was interested in drawing, but when I got my first computer I suddenly started to engage more with it, I was not interested in games ðŸ˜Œ (or else I would have wasting my time there), Coming back to point, I was really surprised how big internet and tech is, I began exploring new apps started being tech savvy. Now when I am here remembering about those days, I am happy, Now I want to mix both art and code into something that will change the world (or else make me happy) </p>
